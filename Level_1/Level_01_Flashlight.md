In this class you will make an LED flashlight.

At your disposal:

* Led's (any flavor)
* Resistors (match what you need in the table)
* switches (Anything in Stock -- feel free to make requests :sparkles: )
* silk-screen (layer 21)
* CR2032 or CR2016 batteries



In the next session, we'll solder these and make second prototypes.
